@dexterous' macos dotfiles castle
===

To better organize setup for different machines with disparate OS's I've split dexterous/dotfiles.

This repo contains configuration specific to Vim/gVim.

History of relevant configurations has been copied over from dexterous/dotfiles and those files will eventually be
deleted from that repo.
